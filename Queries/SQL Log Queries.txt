Some common queries I use to get information from SQL logs.  These are diagnostic settings or audit logs sent to a log analytics workspace

-Review logs for a specific DB and limit output to 100 lines
AzureDiagnostics 
  | where ResourceId == '/SUBSCRIPTIONS/<your subs ID>/RESOURCEGROUPS/<your rsrc grp>/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.SQL/SERVERS/<YOURSERVERNAME>/DATABASES/<YOURDBNAME>' 
  | project event_time_t, statement_s, succeeded_s, affected_rows_d, server_principal_name_s, client_ip_s, application_name_s, additional_information_s, data_sensitivity_information_s
  | order by event_time_t desc
  | take 100

-filtered query ignoring specific details like client IP
AzureDiagnostics
| project event_time_t, statement_s, succeeded_s, affected_rows_d, client_ip_s, session_server_principal_name_s, database_principal_name_s, database_name_s, object_name_s, additional_information_s, application_name_s, host_name_s, client_tls_version_name_s, data_sensitivity_information_s
| where client_ip_s !in ('255.255.255.255', '0.0.0.0')

-Output in local time, limit a certain app that is connecting, sort by the time, summarize and only show the unique client IP values
AzureDiagnostics
| extend EasternTime = datetime_utc_to_local(TimeGenerated, "US/Eastern")
| where application_name_s contains "PowerBIPremium"
| order by event_time_t desc
| summarize arg_max(event_time_t, statement_s, succeeded_s, affected_rows_d, client_ip_s, host_name_s, session_server_principal_name_s, database_principal_name_s, database_name_s, object_name_s, additional_information_s, application_name_s, client_tls_version_name_s, data_sensitivity_information_s) by client_ip_s

-Specifc example where I am searching for powerbi connections, ignoring the on prem servers
AzureDiagnostics
| extend EasternTime = datetime_utc_to_local(TimeGenerated, "US/Eastern")
| where application_name_s contains "Mashup Engine"
| where host_name_s !in ('powerbi3', 'powerbi2','powerbi1')
| project EasternTime, succeeded_s, host_name_s, client_ip_s, server_principal_name_s, statement_s, database_name_s, application_name_s, action_name_s, Category, Type, Resource, session_server_principal_name_s, ResourceProvider, LogicalServerName_s, _ResourceId
