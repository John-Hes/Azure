I created this budget policy because there was no built in policy to create this across all subscriptions.  As of August 2025 this does not seem to be a built in policy.
It is very important to track costs and having a default configuration on a subscription is very helpful.  When a new subscription is created it will automatically get a default budget to alert the 
distribution group.

Difficulties:



Future updates:
  - Some subscriptions have additional owners/managers for the subscription and they should also receive these alerts.  Right now I manually add these users after the policy makes the budget.  An improvement would be leveraging a tag with that information and including that in the recipients.
