Here I am highlighting several policies to automatically configure Defender across all subscriptions.
Some of these Defenders already have built in policies but I have needed some tweaks to features we want to use.
Also some Defenders have new features arrive in preview that we want to enable but the policy was not updated yet. Some of these custom policies may not be needed if more up to date built in policies become available.
For example the Defender for CSPM has had multiple features go into preview and then full release.  As of 12/1/2025 there is already another feature I need to test and update.
